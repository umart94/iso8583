obfuscation

encryption decryption - two way process

masking - irreversible process
data is obfuscated using some random data
we cannot restore data back into original data

symmetric key cryptography

the sender and the receiver both share the same key.



asymmetric key cryptography

sender uses Public key of receiver to encrypt original data
encrypted ciphertext is transmitted to the receiver
the receiver uses his own private key and converts it to original data






uses of these types of cryptography are :
generation and validation of cvc ( printed on back of card )
generation and validation of pin data

emv - chip cards

storage of data inside a chip
cryptogram validation



HSM is a hardware security module

tamper resistant hardware which performs 

key generation and key storage
encryption and decryption

the hsm connects to transaction switch and payment applications for performing cryptographic functions
