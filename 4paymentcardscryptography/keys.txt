data encrypting keys : 
1. keys that are used to encrypt data between 2 parties
2. also used to generate some payment card related cryptograms ( like cvv, cvc etc.)



2. key encrypting keys

keys are not stored in clear form
keys that are used to encrypt the keys


ISSUER CMS <- PIN ENCRYPTION KEY <- PIN PRINTING VENDOR




KEY ENCRYPTING KEYS


issuer does not store the key in clear as is

issuer have their own master key which is a key encrypting key



trusted link between two parties in an ecosystem is called as zone

few keys : 

1. zone master key
every 2 parties share a zone master key
this is used to exchange any keys between entities in a zone
this is a key encrypting key





2. pin related keys : 
zone pin key
pin is never transmitted in clear between two parties. it is transmitted as a pin block
each pair of entities share a unique key for pin transmission. this pin key is encrypted under a zone master key
then called as a zone pin key.

it is a data encrypting key



pin verification key
cardholder pin is never stored in clear in system

a pvv pin verification value or a pin offset is generated against a pin number and stored in issuer system


to generate and validate the pin , a pin verification key is used.

it is a data encrypting key.




card verification key (CVK)
cvc / cvv 2 = 3 digit number printed on back of card
cvc cvv 1 = 3 digit number printed inside the mag stripe.


a CVK key is required to generate a CVC
CVC is generated at the time of generating a new card
the same CVK key is used to verify a cvc during the transaction

seperate keys are required for cvc1 and cvc2



THESE WERE ALL SYMMETRIC KEYS.
