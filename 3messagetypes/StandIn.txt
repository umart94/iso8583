standin processing STIP 

is a process where if issuer or acquirer is unavailable scheme takes a decision on their behalf

scheme acts like a backup on behalf of issuer or acquirer


Scenario that enforces STIP : 

1. connectivity to issuer is down
issuer does not respond in time limit
schemes continuously receieves timeouts


issuer signs off intentionally

maintenance activity.







stand in parameters

schemes provide following options for issuers to setup which are used by schemes to decide the authorization

1. transaction parameters
2. exception files ( positive and negative file) whitelist or blacklist certain accounts
3. request scheme to perform pin emv checks






Transaction parameters that issuers can send : 

1. issuers can send count of approved transactions for a given account ( per day)
2. amount of approved transactions for a given account ( per day)
3. single transaction amount.




Exception Files:

1. Schemes maintain positive and negative files.
2. it is updated by issuers to pass good / bad accounts


3. negative file

issuers provide details of cards for which transactions to be declined

closed, blocked, delinquent( means tending to commit crime)

positive files

issuers provide details of special vip cardholders for which different transaction parameters to be applied.




How stand in works ?



1. acquirer sends 0100 auth request to scheme BUT ISSUER NOT PRESENT
2. SCHEME stands on behalf of issuer and decides the authorization and authorization is storeed in SAF File. store and forward queue.
3. sceheme responds to acquirer
4. issuer requests for an advice retrieval from saf
5. scheme provides the authorization advices to issuer.


decision made by scheme for advice cannot be modified by issuer.



ISSUER will request for advices to scheme via administrative messages (0800) refferred to as a advice retrieval mode.
