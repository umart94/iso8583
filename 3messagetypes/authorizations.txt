Authorization : 

1. Scenario 1 - authorization Normal Flow ( 0100 - 0110)

Acquirer -> 011 Auth Req -> Scheme -> 0100 Auth Req -> Issuer

Acquirer <- 0110 auth response <- scheme <- 0110 auth response <- issuer




2. Secnario 2 - Authorization - Communication Failure To Scheme (0100)

if scheme is not reachable from acquirer nothing happens, 
acquirer shows error message at terminal scheme is not reachable



3. Scenario 3 - Authorization - Communication Failure Between Scheme and Issuer (0100 & 0120)

i.e Acquirer delivers message to scheme, but scheme is not able to deliver to issuer


Acquirer -> [1] 0100 auth req -> scheme -> [1] DOES NOT HAPPEN -> Issuer
Acquirer <- [2] 0110 auth response <- SCHEME STAND-IN <- ISSUER NOT AVAILABLE




if ISSUER OPTED FOR STAND IN, scheme responds to acquirer on behalf of issuer


ONCE ISSUER IS AVAILABLE SCHEME SENDS AN 0120 auth advice to issuer [3]
issuer responds with 0130 auth advice

an advice message means issuer CANNOT MODIFY DECISION taken by Scheme.




4. Scenario 4 - Authorization - Communication Failure to acquirer (0100 & 0420)

Scheme is not able to reach acquirer during authorization response.



acquirer -> 0100 auth req scheme -> 0100 auth req -> issuer

acquirer <- 0110 auth response <- scheme <- 0110 auth response <- issuer


Scheme will send a 420 message to issuer called 420 reversal advice


issuer will receive it and sends 430 reversal advice response
